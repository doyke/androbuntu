= Installation =
The firecracker control code is compatible only with a specific version of the [https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyusb/ PyUSB wrapper]: *1.0.0-alpha-0*

= Firewall Configuration =

However, to get Firestarter working correctly in Ubuntu 11.10, you need to follow [http://askubuntu.com/questions/52817/system-log-error-when-running-firestarter-configuration-program/52832#52832 these instructions].

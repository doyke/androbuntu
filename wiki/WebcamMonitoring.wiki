= Controlling the Logitech Orbit =

For the Logitech Orbit, I found an [http://wiki.brokennexus.com/Zoneminder_and_Motion_setup_for_Logitech_Orbit_Sphere_PTZ old guide], but things have changed for Oneiric and later.

== GUI Control ==
The guvcview application allows pan-tilt control.

`sudo apt-get install guvcview`


== Command-line Control ==
I wanted to enable Pan/Tilt control and toggle the LED light. First, I ran

`uvcdynctrl --clist`

to see whether those functions were supported. They were not. So I ran

`uvcdynctrl --import=/usr/share/uvcdynctrl/data/046d/logitech.xml`

The `--clist` option thereafter showed support for Pan/Tilt and LED control.

== Pan/Tilt Control ==
Tilt down:

`uvcdynctrl --device=video1 --set="Tilt (relative)" 100`

To tilt in the opposite direction:

`uvcdynctrl --device=video1 --set="Tilt (relative)" -- -100`

== LED Control ==
  * *OFF* `uvcdynctrl --device=video1 --set="LED1 Mode" 0`
  * *ON* `uvcdynctrl --device=video1 --set="LED1 Mode" 1`
  * *BLINKING* `uvcdynctrl --device=video1 --set="LED1 Mode" 2`
The command spits out some warning messages, which you can ignore.

== Zoneminder compatibility ==
To retrieve Zoneminder info about your webcam:

`zmu -d /dev/video0 -q -v`

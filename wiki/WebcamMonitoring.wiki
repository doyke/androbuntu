For the Logitech Orbit, I found an [http://wiki.brokennexus.com/Zoneminder_and_Motion_setup_for_Logitech_Orbit_Sphere_PTZ old guide], but things have changed for Oneiric and later.

I wanted to enable Pan/Tilt control and toggle the LED light. First, I ran

`uvcdynctrl --clist`

to see whether those functions were supported. They were not. So I ran

`uvcdynctrl --import=/usr/share/uvcdynctrl/data/046d/logitech.xml`

The `--clist` option thereafter showed support for Pan/Tilt and LED control.

To change the tilt, for example, I run

`uvcdynctrl --set="Tilt (relative)" 100`

The command spits out some warning messages, which you can ignore.

To tilt in the opposite direction:

`uvcdynctrl --set="Tilt (relative)" -- -100`

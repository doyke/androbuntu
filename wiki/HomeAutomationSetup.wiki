#summary Configuration for home automation

= Introduction =

Upon arrival, I have the system perform a couple of actions:
  * Wake computer from suspend mode
  * Turn on lights

= Wake-On-LAN Configuration =

Setting up Wake-On-LAN (WOL) was somewhat complicated, as I have two "daisy-chained" routers, with DD-WRT on both.  Both routers use NAT.

The "top-level" router provides wireless internet for the apartment, while the second router serves as a wireless client, providing hard-wired ethernet in my room.

Since the Android device connects to the top-level router, the "Magic Packet" must be across the second router. Normally, the magic packet is transmitted on the "broadcast address" of the subnet, but I was unable set up port forwarding to the broadcast address on the secondary router.  I was able to forward port 9 to a specific IP address on the subnet, but as I learned, the magic packet targets a specific MAC address, and the association between MAC and IP can be lost when a host is suspended.  To prevent this, I followed [http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WOL#Remote_Wake_On_LAN_via_Port_Forwarding these instructions] to create a static ARP entry, using my own IP and MAC address:
{{{
ip neigh change 192.168.1.3 lladdr ab:cd:ef:ab:cd:ef nud permanent dev br0
ip neigh add 192.168.1.3 lladdr ab:cd:ef:ab:cd:ef nud permanent dev br0
}}}
